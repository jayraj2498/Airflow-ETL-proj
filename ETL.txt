## ETL 

1) extract , transform , load  


* Life cycle of DS proj / DE proj : -



# ETL pipeline / Data pipeline 

1) source of data : 

source of data can be 1) api , 2) internal Db 3) iot device 4) paid api 


AS data engineer team will do data pipeline they integrate combine all the abouve  data source together : 
- They do some kind of preprocesssing and transformation 
- they combine all the data and try to convert it into "json" format :which will have entire data together
- all this combine data will be store in one specific source  

so we take all the data from various source is called --> Extract 
and preprocesssing and trasform (cleaning) and converting into format(json) --> transform 
so we have json data we store it in some kind of sorce -- > Load (sql,nosql DB)


* DS will be dependend on sorce  -- > Load (sql,nosql DB)


* Airflow is opensorce platform which will help you to create Data Pipeline which include (ETL)
* Inside the Airflow we schedule all the abouve process  


small proj :

we read data from :-> API  
then we transform it :-> convert int into json 
then we store it into DB (postgre) 

-- all abouve process we will schedule we use Airflow :
Q , Why Schedule ? -> Bcoz if we have data for every day, weeek to schedule this we use airflow (we can setup everything)

All postgre will run it in docker conatiner so it will independent  



### project  ### 

1st step : 
E->T->L
API -> transform->Load  

- download astro through command winget install -e --id Astronomer.Astro 
- then , type astro dev init 


we make docker-compose.yml file cause : airflow , and postgre are both running on diff-diff docker conatiner :
to intract both conatiner we use this file . 



API : - 
This time we crate a task where we are reading from api and use difff operater -- > 
HTTP operater -> in most of the use cases we have to read the data from api 

how we setup the connection ? -> in such a way that we will able to read witth help of airflow 

Transformation : - 
this will generric python code which perform like from api it will take some detail 


LOad:- 
postrgre we run this is docker coantianer 
to load the data we use the hook (postgrehooks )  if cloud (then s3 hook)  all features are provided by airflow     


-------------------------------------------- 
we make docker-compose.yml file cause : airflow , and postgre are both running on diff-diff docker conatiner :
to intract both conatiner we use this file 

1) Inside dags folder we crete file etl.py --> inside we crete mul task like (ETL) 
 here we use python oprater we use to execute python function 

 inside the airflow if we want to hit api we use python operator 







# at the end of the step to see the postgre conn we require DB+viwer

### Project Overview: Airflow ETL Pipeline with Postgres and API Integration
This project involves creating an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using Apache Airflow. The pipeline extracts data from an external API (in this case, NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) API), transforms the data, and loads it into a Postgres database. The entire workflow is orchestrated by Airflow, a platform that allows scheduling, monitoring, and managing workflows.

The project leverages Docker to run Airflow and Postgres as services, ensuring an isolated and reproducible environment. We also utilize Airflow hooks and operators to handle the ETL process efficiently.

Key Components of the Project:
Airflow for Orchestration:

Airflow is used to define, schedule, and monitor the entire ETL pipeline. It manages task dependencies, ensuring that the process runs sequentially and reliably.
The Airflow DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) defines the workflow, which includes tasks like data extraction, transformation, and loading.
Postgres Database:

A PostgreSQL database is used to store the extracted and transformed data.
Postgres is hosted in a Docker container, making it easy to manage and ensuring data persistence through Docker volumes.
We interact with Postgres using Airflow’s PostgresHook and PostgresOperator.
NASA API (Astronomy Picture of the Day):

The external API used in this project is NASA’s APOD API, which provides data about the astronomy picture of the day, including metadata like the title, explanation, and the URL of the image.
We use Airflow’s SimpleHttpOperator to extract data from the API.
Objectives of the Project:
Extract Data:

The pipeline extracts astronomy-related data from NASA’s APOD API on a scheduled basis (daily, in this case).
Transform Data:

Transformations such as filtering or processing the API response are performed to ensure that the data is in a suitable format before being inserted into the database.
Load Data into Postgres:

The transformed data is loaded into a Postgres database. The data can be used for further analysis, reporting, or visualization.
Architecture and Workflow:
The ETL pipeline is orchestrated in Airflow using a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph). The pipeline consists of the following stages:

1. Extract (E):
The SimpleHttpOperator is used to make HTTP GET requests to NASA’s APOD API.
The response is in JSON format, containing fields like the title of the picture, the explanation, and the URL to the image.
2. Transform (T):
The extracted JSON data is processed in the transform task using Airflow’s TaskFlow API (with the @task decorator).
This stage involves extracting relevant fields like title, explanation, url, and date and ensuring they are in the correct format for the database.
3. Load (L):
The transformed data is loaded into a Postgres table using PostgresHook.
If the target table doesn’t exist in the Postgres database, it is created automatically as part of the DAG using a create table task.
