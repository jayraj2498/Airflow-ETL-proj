## ETL 

1) extract , transform , load  


* Life cycle of DS proj / DE proj : -



# ETL pipeline / Data pipeline 

1) source of data : 

source of data can be 1) api , 2) internal Db 3) iot device 4) paid api 


AS data engineer team will do data pipeline they integrate combine all the abouve  data source together : 
- They do some kind of preprocesssing and transformation 
- they combine all the data and try to convert it into "json" format :which will have entire data together
- all this combine data will be store in one specific source  

so we take all the data from various source is called --> Extract 
and preprocesssing and trasform (cleaning) and converting into format(json) --> transform 
so we have json data we store it in some kind of sorce -- > Load (sql,nosql DB)


* DS will be dependend on sorce  -- > Load (sql,nosql DB)


* Airflow is opensorce platform which will help you to create Data Pipeline which include (ETL)
* Inside the Airflow we schedule all the abouve process  


small proj :

we read data from :-> API 
then we transform it :-> convert int into json 
then we store it into DB (post) 

-- all abouve process we will schedule we use Airflow :
Q , Why Schedule ? -> Bcoz if we have data for every day, weeek to schedule this we use airflow (we can setup everything)

All postgre will run it in docker conatiner so it will independent  



### project  ### 

1st step : 
E->T->L
API -> transform->Load  

we make docker-compose.yml file cause : airflow , and postgre are both running on diff-diff docker conatiner :
to intract both conatiner we use this file . 

1) Inside dags folder we crete file etl.py --> inside we crete mul task like ETL
 here we use python oprater we use to execute python function
